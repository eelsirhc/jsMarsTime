# MarsTime library

Christopher Lee, Ashima Research, 2011-

This package implements the Mars24 algorithm in javascript based on the [Allison and McEwen (2000)] paper. Details can be found at [http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/) . The Javascript library is contained entirely in the marstime.js file. A simple application is given in marstimeapp.js to calculate Mars rover times, and test code is tests.js and tests.html to run some basic tests on the library to compare with known data.
	
The library is available under the Modified BSD license. Please retain the references to the algorithm papers by [Allison and McEwen (2000)] and [Allison (1997)]. Publications using the algorithm should reference those papers where appropriate.
